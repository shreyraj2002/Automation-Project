Here's a modified VBA code that combines both operations into a single macro:

Step 1: Extract all rows containing bold text from the source sheet into a new sheet.
Step 2: Delete all rows containing bold text from the source sheet.

VBA Code:

Sub ExtractAndDeleteBoldRows()
    Dim wsSource As Worksheet
    Dim wsTarget As Worksheet
    Dim sourceRow As Range
    Dim targetRow As Integer
    Dim lastRow As Long
    Dim i As Long
    Dim cell As Range
    Dim isBold As Boolean
    
    ' Set the source sheet
    Set wsSource = ThisWorkbook.Sheets("Sheet1") ' Change to your source sheet name
    
    ' Create or set the target sheet
    On Error Resume Next
    Set wsTarget = ThisWorkbook.Sheets("BoldRows")
    If wsTarget Is Nothing Then
        Set wsTarget = ThisWorkbook.Sheets.Add
        wsTarget.Name = "BoldRows"
    End If
    On Error GoTo 0
    
    targetRow = 1 ' Start pasting in the first row of the target sheet

    ' Find the last row in the source sheet
    lastRow = wsSource.Cells(wsSource.Rows.Count, 1).End(xlUp).Row

    ' Loop through rows from bottom to top to avoid row shifting issues
    For i = lastRow To 1 Step -1
        isBold = False
        
        ' Check each cell in the row for bold text
        For Each cell In wsSource.Rows(i).Cells
            If cell.Font.Bold Then
                isBold = True
                Exit For ' No need to check further if a bold cell is found
            End If
        Next cell
        
        ' If a bold cell is found, copy the row to the target sheet
        If isBold Then
            wsSource.Rows(i).Copy wsTarget.Rows(targetRow)
            targetRow = targetRow + 1 ' Move to the next row in the target sheet
            
            ' Delete the row from the source sheet
            wsSource.Rows(i).Delete
        End If
    Next i

    MsgBox "Bold rows have been extracted and deleted."
End Sub


Key Parts of the Code:
Extract Bold Rows: The code first checks each row for bold text. If bold text is found, the row is copied to a new sheet named BoldRows.
Delete Bold Rows: After copying, the same row is deleted from the source sheet.
Handling the Target Sheet: If the target sheet doesn't exist, it is created with the name "BoldRows". If it already exists, it uses the existing sheet.
How to Use the Code:
Open the VBA Editor by pressing Alt + F11.
Insert a New Module: Go to Insert → Module.
Paste the code into the module.
Run the Code: Press F5 or go to Run → Run Sub/UserForm.
After running the macro, all rows containing bold text will be copied to the new sheet (BoldRows), and those rows will be deleted from the source sheet.
